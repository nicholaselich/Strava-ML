# Strava-ML

## Background
As an avid runner and aspiring Data Scientist, I had an exciting opportunity to combine my interests by analyzing my own running data. Using runs recorded on my Garmin Forerunner 735XT watch and uploaded to the popular exercise tracking app Strava, I developed a neural network model with PyTorch to predict my future race times based on predictors such as Elevation Gain and # of Rest Hours. 

## Workflow
- Data Preparation: data download from Strava, initial look at data
- EDA: descriptive statistics/histograms, data cleaning, correlation analysis
- Modeling: fitting and tuning the optimal model
- Inference: making an upcoming race prediction

Please feel free to peruse the notebooks above to see my thought processes!

## Application
My next race is a 10k Turkey Trot on November 28th and my model says I should complete the race in just under 38 minutes. I'm excited to see how close it'll be!
